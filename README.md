## Installation

To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies.

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tibicle/react_demo_task.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd react_demo_task
```

3. Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```
Create the .env.development file to avoid development errors.

This file is used to set environment variables for the development environment.

In the root of your project, create a new file named .env.development and add the following:

ini
Copy
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/
You can replace http://localhost:5000/ with the URL of the API or any other development-specific settings your project needs.

## Getting Started

Once you have the dependencies installed, you can run the development server and start building your app.

1. To start the development server, run:

```bash
npm run start
```

2. Visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to see the application running.
